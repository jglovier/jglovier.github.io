<p>So here's the process of my design for CURE International's (<a href="http://vimeo.com/cure">vimeo.com/​cure</a>) upcoming direct mail.</p>

<p>It's an 11 x 17 poster intended to illustrate how our donors are part of the larger "CURE family" of patients, families, doctors, staff and communities where our facilites are located.</p>

<p>I was almost entirely built out in Photoshop CS5. Images mostly taken by Bryce Alan Flurie (<a href="http://vimeo.com/​brycealanflurie">vimeo.com/​brycealanflurie</a>) and some from staff in the field.</p>

<p>Music track is "Cherry Twist" by The Crystal Method, and you can <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/​us/​album/​cherry-twist/​id364033?i=364015">find it on iTunes here</a>.</p>

<p>Video was created with an OSX screenshot utility app called InstantShot! and Quicktime 7.</p>

<p>Excellent advice from the man who <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758">wrote the book</a> (literally) on web usability. In this article he advocates for DIY usability testing when you can't afford to hire a usability expert (and who can anyway?!).</p>

<p>A few things I took away as really great advice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do testing one morning a month. Just a morning, and it won't kill a whole day, but do it every month, and you'll quickly accumulate a great practice of getting valuable insights regularly as you work on new projects (or the same old one).</p></li>
<li><p>Do testing in person, and get everyone who develops on your team to observe it. There's nothing like watching somebody in person use what you've designed/built. It will give you monumentally helpful insights into how people use your site who are not you!</p></li>
<li><p>Just pick three people at a time, and spend about an hour watching each. That will give you a really solid set of issues to discover about your site, and it's not overwhelming when you do just three.</p></li>
</ol>

### üëã Hi! I‚Äôm Joel Glovier. I'm a human being human.

I design and build software for humans. I phrase it that way because it's easy to forget that everyone is human. We often tend to think first in foremost of people in terms of what they do (their job role or profession), or their status as something in our society or culture, or in relationship to us. But everyone is first and foremost, a person.

The software I've worked on for most of my career is developer tooling.

I've worked on code collaboration workflows at [GitHub](https://blog.github.com/2016-12-07-introducing-review-requests/), deployment solutions at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [mobile and responsive design](/case-studies/appendto/implementing-the-responsive-redesign-of-time-com/) at [appendTo](http://appendto.com/) as a design engineer, open source projects like [HospitalRun](http://hospitalrun.io/), and most recently I worked on [collaboration tooling](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/platform/introducing-the-apollo-explorer/) for the humans who build GraphQL APIs at [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/).

Prior to my years focused on developer tooling software I was part of a technology at an NGO that runs a global network of charitable children's hospitals called [CURE International](http://cure.org/).

I enjoy [writing](/writing/) about things I learn, [speaking](http://github.com/jglovier/speaking) occasionally, and collecting experiences. I also enjoy using [side projects](/#projects) to learn new things, hone my skills, and explore design trends.

I'm a Pacific Northwest transplant where I live with my family and enjoy the beauty of nature and an abundance of skateparks. I'm a believer in the power of unconditional love and in honoring the humanity and divinity in all people. 

Some things that bring me joy are: painting and drawing, writing, reading (lots of non-fiction, but easing my way into some the world of novels), making music, hiking, playing Overwatch and board games with my kids, [skating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHG2lUYlUs8) & [snowboarding](/post-images/boyceparkrail.jpg), [mural painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUqVSPFgMcw), [breakdancing](/post-images/bboy-jag.jpg), [cooking](http://joelglovier.com/writing/food/), exploring Mt. Rainier, seeing the water, and beautiful sunsets. üåÖ

Now that you know so much about me, [feel free to say hello!](http://twitter.com/home?status=@jglovier%20Hi%20Joel!)

This site was built with care...and lots of inspiration and tooling made available for free on the internet!

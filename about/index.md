<p class="lead" markdown="1">I’m Joel Glovier. I’m a Product Designer Lead at [GitHub](https://github.com/jglovier), where I’m focused on user growth.</p>

Prior to GitHub I was a visual design engineer and tech lead at [appendTo](http://appendto.com/), a front-end shop, where I worked on awesome client projects like the [TIME Magazine responsive redesign](http://appendto.com/case-study/responsive-design-time-com). Prior to that I was principal designer at an amazing nonprofit called [CURE International](http://cure.org/), and I still stay involved with CURE in my free time as a core contributor to the open source project [HospitalRun](http://hospitalrun.io/). And prior still I did freelance graphic and web design full-time for several years. <!---<a href="#background" class="more-link">[read more about my background]</a>-->

I enjoy [writing](/writing/) about things I learn, [speaking](https://lanyrd.com/profile/jglovier/) about stuff I’ve experienced, and collecting experiences in general. I also enjoy using [side projects](http://www.devte.es/) to learn new things, to stay fresh, and to collect said experiences. <!---<a href="#side-projects" class="more-link">[read more about my side projects]</a>-->

I love [writing code](https://github.com/jglovier?tab=repositories) because I love building things. <!---<a href="#things-i-love" class="more-link">[read more about things I love]</a>-->

I love [Jesus](http://joelglovier.com/writing/brokenness-and-restoration/) because of his message of freedom and [restoration](/writing/brokenness-and-restoration/). I’m not a religious person, but I’m a devoted and unashamed Jesus-follower. <!---<a href="/good-news" class="more-link">[read more about why I love Jesus]</a>-->

I have a wonderful family and community where I live in central Pennsylvania (I work remotely for GitHub, as does approximately 50% of the company). I’m originally from the [Pittsburgh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh) area (shoutout [Greensburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensburg,_Pennsylvania)), but currently reside in [Mechanicsburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanicsburg,_Pennsylvania), PA.

In my "spare time" I enjoy getting away from the computer screen with other creative outlets like working on my [project car](https://github.com/jglovier/project-car), [skateboarding](/post-images/kgrind.jpg) and [snowboarding](/post-images/boyceparkrail.jpg), making [EDM and house mixes](https://soundcloud.com/joelglovier), [photography](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jglovier/), [bboying](/post-images/bboy-jag.jpg), designing tattoos tattoos, [cooking](http://joelglovier.com/writing/food/), the [Pittsburgh Steelers](http://www.steelers.com/), [graffiti art](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv-Do30-P8A), etc.

Now that you know so much about me, [you should say hi!](http://twitter.com/home?status=@jglovier%20Hi%20Joel!)

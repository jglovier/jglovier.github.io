### 👋 Hi! I’m Joel Glovier. I'm a human being human.

...which is just a fun way of saying that I'm on a tech industry sabbatical right now, focused on getting healthy physically and mentally (I have had a life long journey with depression and anxiety), restoring balance to my personal and family life, re-connecting with my soul (my passions, creativity, art, faith, etc), and re-discovering my calling and inspiration for the chapter of life ahead.

In 2018 I served as Head of Design at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) where I worked with a small but mighty team of passionate people making websites faster and deployment simpler.

Before joining Netlify, I was a product design lead at [GitHub](https://blog.github.com/2016-12-07-introducing-review-requests/) where I worked with several teams over the course of my five years there including: platform & ecosystem, core workflow, design systems, the creative department, new user experience, and user growth.

Prior to GitHub I was a visual design engineer and tech lead at [appendTo](http://appendto.com/), a front-end shop, where I worked on awesome client projects like the [TIME Magazine responsive redesign](/case-studies/appendto/implementing-the-responsive-redesign-of-time-com/).

Prior to that I was principal designer at an amazing nonprofit called [CURE International](http://cure.org/), and I still stay involved with CURE in my free time as a core contributor to the open source project [HospitalRun](http://hospitalrun.io/).

And way back in the day I did freelance graphic and web design full-time for several years.

I enjoy [writing](/writing/) about things I learn, [speaking](http://github.com/jglovier/speaking) occasionally, and collecting experiences in general. I also enjoy using [side projects](/#projects) to learn new things and to have a creative outlet.

I have a wonderful family and recently moved to the Pacific Northwest (I work remotely for Netlify, as does approximately 50% of the company). I’m originally from the [Pittsburgh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh) area (shoutout [Greensburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensburg,_Pennsylvania)), and lived in [Central Pennsylvania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanicsburg,_Pennsylvania) for 10 years.

I'm a [Jesus](http://joelglovier.com/writing/brokenness-and-restoration/) follower because of his message of freedom and [restoration](/writing/brokenness-and-restoration/). I’m not a very religious person, but my faith is a core part of who I am. My faith in the person and way of Jesus leads me to deeply value and care about things like social justice, human rights, diversity, equality, and loving and respecting every person I come in contact with as fellow members of the human family and as bearers of the divine image within us all.

In my "spare time" I enjoy getting away from the computer screen with other creative outlets like [skateboarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHG2lUYlUs8) & [snowboarding](/post-images/boyceparkrail.jpg), [mural painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUqVSPFgMcw), working on my [project car](https://github.com/jglovier/project-car), making [EDM and house mixes](https://soundcloud.com/joelglovier), [bboying](/post-images/bboy-jag.jpg), [cooking](http://joelglovier.com/writing/food/), rooting for the [Pittsburgh Steelers](http://www.steelers.com/), and other nerdy stuff.

Now that you know so much about me, [you should say hi!](http://twitter.com/home?status=@jglovier%20Hi%20Joel!)

This site was built with care...and lots of inspiration and tooling made available for free on the internet!
